# Legacy Proxies

## Status
**DEPRECATED**

## Description
The repository historically contained proxy scripts for connecting to cloudX instances:
- `distribution/bin/cloudX-proxy.sh` (Unix)
- `Windows/cloudx-proxy.ps1` (Windows)

## Replacement
These scripts have been superseded by the dedicated **cloudX-proxy** repository.
- GitHub: `https://github.com/easytocloud/cloudX-proxy`
- The new proxy tool provides improved functionality, better SSH config management, and cross-platform support.

## Action
The legacy scripts in this repository are being archived/removed to prevent confusion. Users should be directed to the `cloudX-proxy` repository for client-side setup.
